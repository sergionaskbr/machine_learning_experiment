# Machine Learning Experiment: a repository for training 16 algorithms in classification, regression and clustering.

This experiment is the final project of the Machine Learning Fundamentals discipline of the DS Community Data Science Course. 
A test was carried out to find the best parameters and metrics for 4 classification algorithms, 10 regression algorithms and 2 clustering algorithms, the results of which are shown below.
